### conch

conch (Contract Checker) is a tool
that we have implemented for monitoring
and enforcing executable contracts
at run time.

####### Smart contracts
An executable contract (also called a smart contract) 
is (at least under my personal definition) a conventional 
contract that can be converted into executable code, 
executed and enforced programmatically at run-time.

####### Smart contracts and blockchain
The main feature of a smart contract is that its
executable and capable of monitoring and enforcing 
contractual commitments (rights, obligations and
prohibitions) at run--time. 

A smart contract can be implemented
using a centralised or a distributed approach. The
distributed approach involves the achievement of
consensus between several remote parties,
consequently, the implementation of
distributed smart contracts is significantly
simplified by the support of 
middleware services offered by blockchain 
technology.

The current implementation of conch follows a 
centralised approach and therefore, does not
rely on blockchain.
