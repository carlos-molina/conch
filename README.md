conch
=====

conch (Contract Checker) is a tool
that we have implemented for monitoring
and enforcing executable contracts
at run time.

An executable contract (also called a smart contract) 
is (at least under my personal definition) a conventional 
contract that can be converted into executable code, 
executed and enforced programmatically at run-time.
